Change links, images and attachments URLs from 'http' to 'https' in posts, pages and comments after installing an SSL certificate on your site.

== Description ==

**It doesn't work with the latest versions of WordPress, and as there is no demand for it, there will be no updates.**

After installing an SSL certificate on your site, usually, a warning about parts of your page not being secure will appear, and that's because you have a lot of http URLs left in your posts, pages, comments, etc. This plugin will replace all those http URLs with https' URLs.

Running the plugin is not garantee that the warning will disappear. You can check in the console of your browser to see what's left that's still causing the warning to appear.

== Installation ==
